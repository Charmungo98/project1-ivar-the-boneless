        <h2>The Vikings - An unknown enemy</h2>
        <p>
          The Vikings first began their invasion of Britain in AD 793, a
          historic year between two "nations" that sparked the beginning of a
          200 year war between the Vikings and the Anglo Saxons. The centuries
          long war saw the loss of countless lives of men, women and children,
          some innocent and some... less so. The vast majority of the Vikings
          inital raids were fueled purely by greed, however, as the decades
          progressed the invasions were spurred by an alterior motive... the
          need to conquer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vikings initial attack saw the seige of a monestary at
          Lindisfarne. Lindisfarne is a small island off the Northeast coast of
          England. The Vikings took no mercy upon the poor Monks that inhabited
          this tiny island, many were drowned, slaughtered like cattle or used
          as slaves. Following the seige of Lindisfarne, many nearby villages in
          and isles were pillaged and plundered by the savage beasts from
          Scandenavia and within a few years after the first attack in AD 789,
          none of the British Isles were safe.

        <h2>The Vikings take over</h2>
        <p>
          By AD 866 the Vikings had plundered and ravaged their way through
          northern England, parts of Scotland and parts of Ireland, reigning
          terror wherever they went. The Danish Vikings had by now taken the
          city of York (Jorvik) and turned it into a kingdom of their own. The
          Kings of Northumbria at the time, Aelle and Osbert, managed to flee
          the captured city with their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the Vikings securing York, King Alfred came to power in AD
          871, he was the first English King to turn the tables on the Vikings,
          defeating them at the battle of Edington in AD 878. After this
          historic victory the Viking leader at the battle of Edingotn, Guthrum,
          converted to Christianity. Guthrum's conversion was a milestone in
          turning the tides of war on the Vikings.

        <h2>England Strikes Back</h2>
        <p>
          AD 886, Aflred defeated the Vikings once again and successfully
          returned London to English rule. Alfred successfully signed a treaty
          with Guthrum in the same year, the treaty saw to partition England
          between the Vikings and the English, viewing Viking territory as
          'Danelaw'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, in AD 937 led the Enlgish to a victory
          over the Vikings at the battle of Brunaburh and became the first
          English King to incoporate Danelaw into his kingdom. By AD 954 the
          last Viking leader of York, Eirik Bloodaxe, was defeated in battle and
          for the first time since AD 866, York was under Enlgish rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite Athelstan's victory the Viking raids did not cease, different
          bands of Vikings continued to make regular voyages to the coast of
          England for decades after the battle of Brunaburh. In AD 991
          Aethelred, the King of England at the time, Olaf Tryggvason's raiding
          party defeated the English defenders Aethelred was forced to pay off
          the raiders in an attempt to pay off a further invasion and plunge
          England into Danelaw once again.

        <h2>Return of the Vikings</h2>
        <p>
          The Vikings were not defeated just yet, England would see four further
          Viking Kings between AD 1013 and AD 1042, the strongest of these kings
          was King Cnut. King Cnut was the king of Denmark and England during
          his reign, however, King Cnut was unlike any Danish King before him,
          he was a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          King Cnut did not force England to obey Danelaw and, in fact,
          recognised Anglo-Saxon law as well as Danelaw. He attempted to
          engineer a North Atlantic empire in which Scandanavia and Britain
          would be a united front. King Cnut, depsite his large aspirations, saw
          an early grave at the age of 39 and his succesor, his son, did not
          have the successful reign his Father before him had enjoyed..

        <h2>The Normans take over</h2>
        <p>
          The last of the true Viking invasions of England technically occured
          in AD 1066. Harald Hardrada, King of Norway at the time, sailed up the
          River Humber and then marched his men to stamford Bridge, Harold
          Godwinson, King of England at the time, marched his army north to meet
          Harald Hardrada, Hardrada was defeated after a hard and bloody battle
          was fought. England had repelled its last invasion from the Vikings
          that would ever occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately for Harold Godwinson, William the Conquerer (who was of
          Viking decent but identified as French, previous generations of
          Vikings had landed on Normandy's shores over a century ago but over
          time had adopted the French way of life), invaded the South of
          England.
        </p>
        <p>
          Godwinson's army marched south to meet the Norman invaders but tired
          and bruised from their battle against Harald Hardrada, Godwinson's
          army was no match for William. The English/Viking war was over and the
          Normans rose from the smoke as victors.
