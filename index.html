        <h2>The Vikings - An unknown enemy</h2>
        <p>
          The Vikings first began their invasion of Britain in AD 793, a
          historic year between two "nations" that sparked the beginning of a
          200 year war between the Vikings and the Anglo Saxons. The centuries
          long war saw the loss of countless lives of men, women and children,
          some innocent and some... less so. The vast majority of the Vikings
          inital invasions were fueled purely by greed and their desire to
          plunder, however, as the decades progressed the invasions were spurred
          by an alterior motive, especially the invasions exercised by Ivar the
          Boneless.

          This article will dive into the history of the Vikings, particulary
          the most famous and arguably successful Viking of all, Ivar the
          Boneless, son of Ragnar Lothbrok.The Vikings initial attack saw the
          seige of a monestary at Lindisfarne. Lindisfarne is a small island off
          the Northeast coast of England. The Vikings took no mercy upon the
          poor Monks that inhabited this tiny island, many were drowned,
          slaughtered like cattle or used as slaves. Following the seige of
          Lindisfarne, many nearby villages in and isles were pillaged and
          plundered by the savage beasts from Scandenavia and within a few years
          after the first attack in AD 789, none of the British Isles were safe.

      <h2>The Vikings take over</h2>
      <p>
        By AD 866 the Vikings had plundered and ravaged their way through
        northern England, parts of Scotland and parts of Ireland, reigning
        terror wherever they went. The Danish Vikings had by now taken the city
        of York (Jorvik) and turned it into a kingdom of their own. The Kings of
        Northumbria at the time, Aelle and Osbert, managed to flee the cpatured
        city with their lives, the survival of Aelle goes on to play a key
        factor in the downfall of Ivar the Boneless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the Vikings securing Jorvik, King Alfred came to power in AD
        871, he was the first English King to turn the tables on the Vikings,
        defeating them at the battle of Edington in AD 878. After this historic
        victory the Viking leader at the battle of Edingotn, Guthrum, converted
        to Christianity. Guthrum's conversion was a milestone in turning the
        tides of war on the Vikings
